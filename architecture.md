Software Architecture
==
Software Architecture:
> *The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.*

Architecture in a professional context
--

- Perform many duties beyond directly producing an architecture.
	- supporting management and dealing with customers.
- Architects need more than just technical skills.
	- Architects need to explain chosen priorities.
	- Need diplomatic, negotiation, and communication skills.
	- Architects need the ability to communicate ideas clearly.
	- Manage a diverse workload and switch contexts frequently.
	- Be a leader in the eyes of developers and management.
- Architects need up-to-date knowledge.
	- You will need to know about (for example) patterns, or database platforms, or web services standards.
	- You will need to know business considerations.

###How contexts affect the software architecture:
- Technical context: 
	- Set of quality attributes highly affect the software architecture, 
	- but the architecture is affected also by current technical environment, and the technology and framework used such as web, object-oriented, service-oriented, mobility-aware, cloud-based, social-network friendly.
- Project-life cycle context: 
	- The architecture will limit or dictate what kind of life-cycle model that can be used and vice-versa (e.g. incremental development vs. waterfall vs. scrum etc.)
- Business context: 
	- The business goals will highly affect the software architecture and vice-versa, such as time-to-market, roll-out schedule, changing business environment, time-to-launch etc.
- Professional context: 
	- Software architecture is highly affected by knowledge and skills of the architects such as managerial skills, communication skills, knowledge of patterns, frameworks etc.


why software architecture is important ?
--
- Enabling a systemâ€™s quality attributes, 
- Reasoning and managing change, 
- Predicting system qualities, 
- Enhancing communication among stakeholders, 
- Carrying early design decisions, 
- Defining constraints on an implementation, 
- Influencing the organizational structure, 
- Enabling evolutionary prototyping, 
- Improving cost and schedule estimates, 
- Supporting transferable, reusable model, allowing incorporation of independent components, 
- Restricting the vocabulary of design alternatives, and 
- Providing a basis for training.
